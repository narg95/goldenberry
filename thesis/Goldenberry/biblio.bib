    abstract = {{BACKGROUND: The analysis of complex proteomic and genomic profiles involves the identification of significant markers within a set of hundreds or even thousands of variables that represent a high-dimensional problem space. The occurrence of noise, redundancy or combinatorial interactions in the profile makes the selection of relevant variables harder. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we propose a method to select variables based on estimated relevance to hidden patterns. Our method combines a weighted-kernel discriminant with an iterative stochastic probability estimation algorithm to discover the relevance distribution over the set of variables. We verified the ability of our method to select predefined relevant variables in synthetic proteome-like data and then assessed its performance on biological high-dimensional problems. Experiments were run on serum proteomic datasets of infectious diseases. The resulting variable subsets achieved classification accuracies of 99\% on Human African Trypanosomiasis, 91\% on Tuberculosis, and 91\% on Malaria serum proteomic profiles with fewer than 20\% of variables selected. Our method scaled-up to dimensionalities of much higher orders of magnitude as shown with gene expression microarray datasets in which we obtained classification accuracies close to 90\% with fewer than 1\% of the total number of variables. CONCLUSIONS: Our method consistently found relevant variables attaining high classification accuracies across synthetic and biological datasets. Notably, it yielded very compact subsets compared to the original number of variables, which should simplify downstream biological experimentation.}},

@book{Buschmann96,
    abstract = {{<I>Pattern-Oriented Software Architecture: A System of Patterns</I>
looks at how patterns occur on three different levels--in software architecture,
in everyday design, and in idioms (which describe how a particular design
pattern is implemented in a programming language like C++). This synthetic
approach is a little theoretical at times, but the authors also present over a
dozen patterns and provide real-world examples wherever possible.<p>  For
architectural patterns, the authors look at the Layers pattern, used in
operating systems such as Windows NT and virtual machines. They also consider
Pipes and Filters, which process streams of data. (This pattern, the authors
point out, is a lynchpin of Unix.) Their Blackboard pattern shows how a complex
problem, such as image or speech recognition can be broken up into smaller,
specialized subsystems that work together to solve a problem. (For recognizing
words from a raw waveform input, a Blackboard approach might have separate
processes to find phonemes, then words, then sentences.)<p> This book also looks
at today's distributed systems in considering the Broker pattern, which is used
on the Internet and in Microsoft's OLE technology.  This section also presents
several powerful patterns for building effective graphical user interfaces, such
as Model-View-Controller.<p>  The authors define several well-known design
patterns, such as the Proxy and Command patterns, and also basic, far-reaching
patterns, such as Whole-Part and Master-Slave, which are widely used throughout
computing. Their survey ends with a discussion on the way objects can
communicate (using such patterns as Forwarder-Receiver,
Client-Dispatcher-Server, and Publisher-Subscriber), which many developers will
recognize as familiar patterns, but are codified here as "official" patterns.
The book then discusses some idioms in C++ and a more far-reaching role for
patterns in software design and architecture.  By fitting patterns into
traditional software engineering practices, the authors of <I>Pattern-Oriented
Software Architecture</I> successfully argue that the role for patterns will
only continue to diversify and enrich tomorrow's software engineering tools and
methodologies. <I>--Richard Dragan</I>} {Pattern - Oriented Software
Architecture A System of Patterns Frank Buschmann, Regine Meunier, Hans Rohnert,
Peter Sommerlad, Michael Stal of Siemens AG, Germany Pattern-oriented software
architecture is a new approach to software development. This book represents the
progression and evolution of the pattern approach into a system of patterns
capable of describing and documenting large-scale applications. A pattern system
provides, on one level, a pool of proven solutions to many recurring design
problems. On another it shows how to combine individual patterns into
heterogeneous structures and as such it can be used to facilitate a constructive
development of software systems. Uniquely, the patterns that are presented in
this book span several levels of abstraction, from high-level architectural
patterns and medium-level design patterns to low-level idioms. The intention of,
and motivation for, this book is to support both novices and experts in software
development. Novices will gain from the experience inherent in pattern
descriptions and experts will hopefully make use of, add to, extend and modify
patterns to tailor them to their own needs. None of the pattern descriptions are
cast in stone and, just as they are borne from experience, it is expected that
further use will feed in and refine individual patterns and produce an evolving
system of patterns. Visit our Web Page http://www.wiley.com/compbooks/}},

  INSTITUTION =   {Software Engineering Institute, Carnegie Mellon University},
    ABSTRACT =      {An architectural tactic is a design decision that affects how
well a software architecture addresses a particular quality attribute. This
report describes how tactics are based on the parameters of quality attribute
models. Tactics provide an architectural means of adjusting those parameters,
which, in turn, can improve the quality-attribute-specific behavior of the
resulting system. This report justifies the tactics for modifiability, using
established concepts of coupling, cohesion, and cost motivations as the means of
