\section{Research Hypothesis}
\label{sec:ResHyp}

Dependency networks combined with weighted kernel classifiers for feature relevant estimation will yield to a better understanding of variables interaction increasint the prediction accuracy and generalization capabilities for the relevant subset of variables than others which assume indepencency among features.

Dependency networks combined with weighted kernel classifiers will outperform the generalization capabilities and prediction accuracy for the feature subset than others which assume are variables independent.

Building dependency networks with weighted-kernel classifier will provide a feature subset of a domain problem with a better understanding, prediction accuracy and generalization capabilities compared with others techniques which assume variables are independent.
