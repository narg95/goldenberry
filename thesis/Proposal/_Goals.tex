	a. The first objective is simply a necessary activity in the development of the project.
	b. Second objective should be selected as the main objective.
	c. Fifth should be re-worded to become an evaluable objective.}

a. The first objective was moved to the timeline planning section as an activity.
b. The second objective was selected as the main objective.
c. Fifth objective, in accordance with the supervisor, was removed because it was not an evaluable objective.
}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Design an algorithm for feature relevance estimation by estimating dependency networks combined with weighted kernel classification methods.
	\item Verify the feasibility of the algorithm in high dimensional feature spaces using toy and real datasets (e.g bioinformatics).
	\item Compare algorithm performance with respect to other feature selection methods (e.g. score-based filters, stochastic population-based wrappers and weighted-kernel-based embedded methods).
\end{itemize}
